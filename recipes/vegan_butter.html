        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            I can't believe it's not butter.
        </p>

        <p>
            I can believe that it's mostly coconut oil and soy milk. A match made in heaven, if 
            you ask me, a saturated fats goblin.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Refined Coconut Oil</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Canola Oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Unsweetened Soy Milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tsp Nooch (Nutritional Yeast Flakes)</li>
            <li>1 Small Pinch Turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add melted refined coconut oil to the blender jug along with the canola oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the apple cider vinegar to the unsweetened soy or almond milk and stir 
                in so that it curdles into buttermilk. Add the buttermilk to the blender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the nutritional yeast, small pinch of turmeric and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blend very well until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour out into a butter dish and refrigerate until set.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the fridge to thaw for a few minutes if using on fresh bread 
                or creaming with sugar for baking.
            </li>
        </ol>
