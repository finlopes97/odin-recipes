        <p>
            We used a vegan taco meat as well as black beans 
            for the protein, some pico de gallo salsa, shredded lettuce, 
            chopped avocado and a fabulous tahini sauce to drizzle over the top.

            <li>1/2 Medium Onion (white, yellow or brown)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp Crushed Garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper</li>

            <li>Salt and Pepper (to taste)</li>

            <li>2 Medium Avocados</li>
            <li>12-16 Tortillas</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add the chopped onion to a pan along with the olive oil, crushed garlic, 
                cayenne pepper, chili flakes and ground cumin and sauté until the 
                onions are softened. Add in the black beans and sauté with the onions 
                and spices until heated through. If it’s getting too dry in the pan then 
                add in a little water. Add salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare your shredded lettuce and chopped avocado.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat your tortillas via your preferred method, or by lightly frying in a 
                pan or stacking them up and covering in foil and baking in the oven at 180°C 
                for around 15 minutes until heated through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assemble by adding some shredded lettuce to a tortilla, followed by some 
                vegan taco meat then black beans then pico de gallo, then chopped 
                avocado and top with a drizzle of tahini sauce.
