            This depressing little slurry of chickpeas and mayonaise may end up tasting more like 
            tart, wet cardboard rather than real tuna, but I invite you to ask yourself if 
            real tuna tastes very good in the first place.

            A who's who of spices and herbs come together to salvage whatever they can in this dish, 
            and do they succeed, well I can't answer that. All I can say for sure is that I'd rather
            that than nothing at all. You could add salt and garlic to a mushy pile of paste and 
            I might believe it's real food.
